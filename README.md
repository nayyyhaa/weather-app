â›ˆ Weather app with OpenWeatherMap API

#### User has the ability to
- get weather information by his/her location via GPS
- search weather for specific place
- change the UI to dark/light mode

This website is created using simple **VanillaJs, HTML & CSS**.

#### Here I've used the simple concepts of 
- Event Listeners 
- Reading input in HTML 
- Writing to DOM 
- Templating
- Processing data on user action
- Fetch API
- Asynchrous calls in JS
- toggle classList for dark mode
